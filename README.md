# Token-Information

we created DXN Blockchain as a faster and safer platform for transferring funds with a “one-stop cross-chain” transfer solution. Our mission then became to enable blockchain 3.0 by reducing frictions in the token economy - simpler, faster, safer.
We focus on integrating the world’s major exchanges and blockchains to effectively hedge risks and provide customers with an efficient and easy-to-use platform for cryptocurrency transfers.

The traditional cross-border payment model has higher remittance fees due to high associated costs. It covers expenses related to payment processing, receiving, financial operating and reconciliation. 75% of the mentioned fees account for the transitbank network maintenance costs. The remaining 25% goes to compliance, error investigation, and foreign transfer costs. By integrating AI, through deep learning, big data, and blockchain technology, the DXN platform makes each conversion cost significantly lower.
